Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women worldwide. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively.

The co-founder knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices.

3. Prepare phase

  Data stored.

We are using data called FiBit Fitness. The data stored in Kaggle and Mobius is the owner of this data.

 The privacy, license, and accessibility of the data.

This dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty-three eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.
By checking the metadata we can confirm that the data is for public use, and the owner gives us access to analyze it and share our work.

Information about the data.

The data has 18 CSV files and it contains thirty-three participants. Each document represents different quantitative data tracked by Fitbit.
As I can see, the data is not recently collected; the last update was two years ago.
Each user has a unique Id and the survey has been tracking users’ activity for 31 days 





3.4 Organizing the data.
The data are presented in large format because each subject has information in multiple rows. I have made some changes using Excel to organize the columns, make sure there are no duplicates, take a look at the filter to see if there is any suspiciousness with the data, and adjust the date to be consistent, moreover, I have also named and separated the files into folders as CSV to upload it to SQL. I will use three files which will be the tables( Active, Sleep, and Steps)
Regarding the credibility of the data, it is also considered sample bias data since it’s collected from just thirty-three people without including enough people in the survey and for a short amount of time.



4. Process and analyze phase

programs.
I will work on SQL because I want to focus more on it, and I will use Tableau to create data visualization.
Data integrity.
Although the data was collected from only thirty-three people it still lacks integrity because many participants didn’t provide their information for the 31 days and some fields were left blank which led to uncompleted and inconsistent data.

Working on the data
I will create a database and then create a table for each file. After I finished we can see the schema, details, and preview of the files.
The files that I have uploaded are Activity, Steps, and Sleep.

Now we can start cleaning and analyzing the data.

-- checking the length of the Id 
select Distinct length(cast(Id as string))  numberOfChar
from i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Active
= 10
-- checking how many days people were active 
select Id, count(ActivityDate)
from i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Active
group by Id
 
-- how many users have active days less than 20
select Id, count(ActivityDate)
from i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Active
group by Id
having count(ActivityDate) < 20

3 users have less than 20 days

-- how many users have 31 active days
select Id, count(ActivityDate)
from i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Active
group by Id
having count(ActivityDate) = 31

21 users have 31 active days

-- looking for the average distance and casting from float to integer
select  Id, Avg(Cast(TotalDistance AS integer)) as Total
from i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Active
group by Id, TotalDistance
order by Total desc

The Max distance = 28    and the Min distance = 11 

select  Id, Avg(Cast(TotalDistance AS integer)) as Total, 
  Case
      when TotalDistance <= 17 then "low" 
      when TotalDistance > 23 then "high"
      else "medium"
  end as category

group by Id, TotalDistance
order by Total desc



 
 
 
-- adding the avg of TotalMinutes 
select  Id, Avg(Cast(TotalDistance AS integer)) as Total, Avg(cast(Totalminutes/60 As integer)) as avg_hours,
  Case
      when TotalDistance <= 17 then "low" 
      when TotalDistance > 23 then "high"
      else "medium"
   end as category
from i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Active
group by Id, TotalDistance, TotalMinutes
order by Total desc
1# There were some values in the steps table as a (-) I had to return to Excel to Erase them and I used left join to rely on the Active table.
 
-- joining with the Steps table to find the relationship between distance and calories
select A.Id, Avg(TotalDistance) as avg_distance, avg(Calories) as avg_calories,
from i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Active A

group by A.Id

2# -- joining with the Steps table to find the relationship between distance and steps
select A.Id, avg(TotalDistance)  as avg_distance, avg(TotalSteps) as steps
from i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Active A
left join i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Steps S on A.Id = S.Id 
group by A.Id
order by avg_distance desc

3# -- looking for the relationship between steps and calories
select Id, avg(TotalSteps) as steps, avg(Calories) calories
from  i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Steps 
group by Id
order by steps desc
 
 
 
4#-- looking for the relationship between hours of sleep and calories
select S.Id, avg(Calories) as calories, avg(TotalHoursAsleep) sleep_hours
from  i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Steps S
join  i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Sleep_Hours H on S.Id = H.Id
where H.SleepDay between '2016-05-01' and '2016-05-12'
group by S.Id
order by calories  desc
5#-- joining three tables to find the connection between Active hours, Calories, and sleep hours
select A.Id, avg(Totalminutes/60)avtive_hours, avg(Calories) as calories,
avg(TotalHoursAsleep) sleep_hours
from  i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Steps S
join  i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Sleep_Hours H on S.Id = H.Id
join  i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Active A on A.Id = S.Id
group by A.Id
ORDER BY Calories DESC
 
-- creating a view
create view `i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.overall` as 
select A.Id, avg(Totalminutes/60)avtive_hours, avg(Calories) as calories, avg(TotalHoursAsleep) sleep_hours
from  i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Steps S
join  i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Sleep_Hours H on S.Id = H.Id
join  i-hexagon-364115.Capstone_CaseStudy.Active A on A.Id = S.Id
group by A.Id
ORDER BY Calories DESC
Verifying process
After I finished cleaning and organizing the data I will make sure that I cleaned all the data from misspellings, additional spaces, non-values, and blanks by comparing the files I create with the original files.

6. Act phase
I actually couldn’t find a complete relationship between factors but surely, there is a connection between some of them that affect one another in some way. For example, Active hours is contributing to burning calories but it is not the only reason it could be training or a physical job, and the same thing to how many steps participants walk per day it is a huge factor but I can see that some of them has lower steps and burning lots of calories.
Another fact is I found out that there is no relationship between sleep and burning calories.
To summarize the analysis, I would advise the company to create an app to track their clients’ activities and a reminder to drink water and when should someone go to bed. Moreover, I would create an app to track their nutrition and give them a diet plan based on their type of life and body. I will also give the clients a 2-month free trial so we can own their trust and at the same time they will get used to our products and they will stick with them after
